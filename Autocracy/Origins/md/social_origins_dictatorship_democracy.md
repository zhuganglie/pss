Barrington Moore Jr.'s "Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy" posits that the political outcomes of modernization (democracy, fascism, or communism) are rooted in the class structure of agrarian societies, particularly the relationship between the landed upper classes and the peasantry.

Moore identifies three distinct paths to the modern world:

*   **The Bourgeois Revolution (Democracy):** This path, taken by countries like England, France, and the United States, involved a revolutionary break with the past led by a strong, independent bourgeoisie. This class, through commercializing agriculture, either overthrew or absorbed the old landed aristocracy, leading to the development of democratic institutions. Moore's famous conclusion for this path is, "No bourgeois, no democracy."

*   **The Revolution from Above (Fascism):** In Germany and Japan, the bourgeoisie was too weak to challenge the landed elite. Instead, a coalition of the landed aristocracy and the emerging commercial and industrial elites led to a "revolution from above." This path modernized the state and economy while suppressing peasant and worker movements, ultimately culminating in fascism.

*   **The Peasant Revolution (Communism):** In Russia and China, the state was highly centralized, and the landed aristocracy was weak. This created an environment where widespread peasant rebellions, in the absence of a significant bourgeois revolution, could overthrow the old order and lead to a communist regime.

In essence, the book argues that the specific historical alliances and conflicts between the monarchy, the landed aristocracy, the peasantry, and the urban bourgeoisie determined whether a country would become a democracy, a fascist state, or a communist one.
