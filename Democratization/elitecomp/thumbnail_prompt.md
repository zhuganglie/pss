# Thumbnail Image Prompt

**Context:**
The podcast discusses the "Elite Competition Theory" of democratization (Ansell & Samuels). It argues that democracy is not a gift to the poor, but a shield for the rich (income elites) against the predatory state. It highlights the difference between immobile "Land Inequality" (hinders democracy) and mobile "Income Inequality" (promotes democracy).

**Title:** 不平等如何影响民主化（续）
**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9
**Style:** Hand-drawn, Ink and Watercolor, Political Editorial Cartoon

**Midjourney / DALL-E Prompt:**
> A hand-drawn editorial illustration in the style of a vintage political cartoon or ink sketch. The scene visualizes the concept of "Elite Competition". On the right, a group of Victorian-era industrial capitalists and merchants are building a fortress made of paper scrolls (representing a Constitution) and ballot boxes to protect their factories and gold from a giant, shadowy, predatory hand coming from the sky (representing the Autocratic State). On the left, landed gentry sit comfortably on their immobile farmland, indifferent to the struggle. The image should have a textured, paper-like background. The composition is balanced for a 16:9 aspect ratio. The title "不平等如何影响民主化（续）" acts as a caption. --ar 16:9

**Visual Elements to Emphasize:**
1.  **The Predatory State:** Depicted as a large hand or looming shadow trying to seize wealth.
2.  **The Shield:** Democracy/Constitution as a protective barrier, not a weapon of the poor.
3.  **Contrast:** Mobile wealth (factories/gold) vs. Immobile wealth (land).
