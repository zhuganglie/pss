The Puzzle: Since Aristotle, we’ve believed that a strong middle class is the backbone of democracy.
The Twist: History shows the middle class often supports military coups (e.g., Thailand, Chile in 1973, Egypt in 2013). The puzzle is that the middle class is only democratic when they fear the dictator more than they fear the poor. If they fear the poor (redistribution) too much, they will hug the dictator.
