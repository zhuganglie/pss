Comparative politics is a field brimming with intriguing puzzles that challenge our understanding of how political systems operate and evolve across the globe. These puzzles, often stemming from unexpected similarities or startling differences between countries, fuel academic debate and drive scholarly inquiry. What follows is a comprehensive list of such puzzles, categorized by subfield, that continue to animate the study of comparative politics.

### Democratization and Regime Change

At the heart of comparative politics lies the study of political regimes. Scholars grapple with why some countries transition to democracy while others remain stubbornly authoritarian.

* **The Survival of Autocracy:** Why do some authoritarian regimes, like China, prove remarkably resilient and adaptable in the face of economic modernization and social change, defying predictions of their imminent collapse?
* **Democratic Backsliding:** What explains the erosion of democratic norms and institutions in established democracies, such as Hungary and Poland, and the rise of illiberal leaders in various parts of the world?
* **The Resource Curse:** Why do countries rich in natural resources, particularly oil, often exhibit lower levels of democracy and higher rates of corruption and conflict compared to their resource-poor counterparts?
* **Waves of Democratization:** What triggers and sustains waves of democratization across different regions, and why do these waves often recede, leaving a mixed landscape of political regimes?
* **Hybrid Regimes:** How do we best conceptualize and explain the stability and dynamics of hybrid regimes that blend democratic and authoritarian features, and are they a transitional phase or a durable new regime type?

### Political Economy of Development

The intricate relationship between politics and economics on a global scale presents a multitude of puzzles for comparativists.

* **The East Asian "Miracle":** What specific combination of state intervention, institutional arrangements, and cultural factors enabled the rapid economic development of several East Asian countries, and can this model be replicated elsewhere?
* **The Persistence of Inequality:** In an era of unprecedented global wealth, why does significant economic inequality persist and, in many cases, grow within and between countries, even in robust democracies?
* **Varieties of Capitalism:** What explains the divergence and persistence of different models of capitalism, such as the liberal market economies of the Anglo-American world and the coordinated market economies of continental Europe, and what are the political consequences of these differences?
* **The Politics of Welfare States:** Why do countries with similar levels of economic development have vastly different welfare state arrangements, ranging from the comprehensive social safety nets of Scandinavia to the more market-oriented systems in other developed nations?
* **Globalization and State Sovereignty:** How has globalization reshaped the economic sovereignty of nation-states, and to what extent can governments still control their economic policies in an interconnected world?

### Political Institutions and Governance

The design and function of political institutions are central to understanding political outcomes, yet their effects are often puzzling.

* **Presidentialism vs. Parliamentarism:** Why do some scholars argue that parliamentary systems are more conducive to democratic stability than presidential systems, and what are the key institutional features that account for these different outcomes?
* **Electoral Systems and Party Systems:** How do different electoral systems (e.g., proportional representation vs. majoritarian) shape the number and nature of political parties in a country, and what are the implications for governance and representation?
* **Federalism and Decentralization:** Under what conditions does federalism or decentralization of power mitigate ethnic conflict and promote stability, and when does it exacerbate tensions and lead to secessionist movements?
* **Judicial Politics and Activism:** Why have judiciaries in some countries become powerful actors in the political process, engaging in judicial activism, while in others they remain relatively weak and subservient to other branches of government?
* **Bureaucratic Quality and Corruption:** What explains the vast differences in the quality and integrity of state bureaucracies across countries, and why do anti-corruption efforts succeed in some contexts but fail spectacularly in others?

### Contentious Politics and Social Movements

The study of how and why people mobilize to challenge the political order is a dynamic area of comparative inquiry.

* **The Arab Spring:** What were the underlying causes of the widespread uprisings across the Arab world in 2011, and why did the outcomes of these movements vary so dramatically, from democratization in Tunisia to civil war in Syria?
* **The Rise of Populism:** What are the common drivers of the recent surge in populist movements and leaders across diverse regions, and what are the long-term consequences for democratic governance?
* **Non-violent vs. Violent Resistance:** Under what conditions are non-violent social movements more successful in achieving their goals than violent insurgencies?
* **The Role of Social Media:** How has the rise of social media transformed the dynamics of political protest and social mobilization, and what are the implications for both democratic and authoritarian regimes?
* **Transnational Activism:** What enables some social movements to effectively organize and exert influence across national borders, while others remain confined to their domestic contexts?

### Civil Conflict and Political Violence

Understanding the causes and consequences of political violence is a somber but crucial task for comparative politics.

* **The Onset of Civil War:** What are the key factors that lead to the outbreak of civil wars, and how do economic grievances, ethnic divisions, and state weakness interact to create a fertile ground for conflict?
* **Ethnic Conflict and Genocide:** Why do some multi-ethnic societies coexist peacefully for long periods, only to erupt in brutal violence and even genocide, as witnessed in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia?
* **The Logic of Terrorism:** What motivates individuals and groups to resort to terrorism, and how do the strategies and targets of terrorist organizations vary across different political and ideological contexts?
* **Post-Conflict Reconstruction:** Why is it so difficult to build lasting peace and stable political institutions in the aftermath of civil wars, and what are the most effective strategies for post-conflict reconstruction?
* **The Decline of Interstate War:** While civil wars have become more prevalent, why has the incidence of large-scale wars between states declined significantly in the post-World War II era?

### State Formation and Nationalism

The origins and evolution of the modern state and the powerful force of nationalism continue to pose fundamental questions.

* **The European State Model:** Why did the nation-state model first emerge in Europe and subsequently spread to the rest of the world, and what are the enduring legacies of this historical trajectory?
* **State Capacity and Fragility:** What explains the vast differences in the capacity of states to perform basic functions, such as collecting taxes, providing public services, and maintaining order, and why do some states become fragile or even collapse?
* **The Puzzle of Nationalism:** Why does nationalism remain such a potent and persistent force in world politics, capable of inspiring both immense loyalty and horrific violence?
* **Identity Politics:** How and why have various forms of identity, based on ethnicity, religion, and other markers, become increasingly salient in the politics of many countries?
* **Citizenship and Belonging:** How do different countries define citizenship and belonging, and what are the political and social consequences of these varying approaches to inclusion and exclusion?

This extensive list of puzzles underscores the dynamism and intellectual richness of comparative politics. By systematically examining these and other questions, scholars in the field strive to develop more nuanced and powerful explanations for the complex political world we inhabit.
